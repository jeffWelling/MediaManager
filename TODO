TODO file for Jeff's MediaManager program

-(July 28 09) Change the way that searchTVDB() caches results, its bulky and can be cleaned up by only referencing
							thetvdb_id which is returned with every result and can be looked up in our local cache.

-(August 18 09) Some of the cache's are implemented using an array, if that
							array grows too big, it could manifest as a memory leak and
							also exponentially increasing processing times
