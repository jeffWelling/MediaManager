TODO file for Jeff's MediaManager program

-(July 27 09) Make hashing of the files an optional argument, default is not to hash every file (not to maintain integrity checks)
-(July 28 09) Change the way that searchTVDB() caches results, its bulky and can be cleaned up by only referencing
							thetvdb_id which is returned with every result and can be looked up in our local cache.
