TODO file for Jeff's MediaManager program


- When run as a new instance, program appears to not consult the MySQL cache for episodes and instead pull from the web, and then skips
the caching process because they are already in the database; evidenced by the '_______' that appears instead of '-----' when it is
caching the episodes.
