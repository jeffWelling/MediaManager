Media Manager is a ruby script designed to collate all the media and video
files into one central directory.  This is not done by copying the data
into one central directory because that also places all of the media on
one device which can/will fail in the future.  By leaving the various
files in place, the storage is allocated at the user's discretion,
and the central directory is built using directories and symlinks to the
origional content.

Media Manager also manages meta-data related to the files, Song and Artist
info, Movie title, links to movie reviews, etc.  This information is stored
in a MySQL database for accessability and to offload the concern of handling,
storing, and protecting the data from corruption.  

Options are configurable from a plaintext file, MediaManager.cfg .
